## Post 1 Question 1

From lecturer "the debate is about everyday ethics (Coleen's approach) versus institutional ethics (for example, BPS ethics). Please focus your analysis specifically on the sting operation itself, although if you think you need to include the wider legal/media context, that is fine."

So when analysing her actions, we're doing it through the lens of "Everyday Ethics"



## Post 1 Question 2

"Do you think Coleen Rooneyâ€™s social psychology experiment was ethical given it was conducted outside the context of institutional research?"

There's two approaches:
- What did the court find, or infer
- What ethics standards can we bring to bear on the actions of an individual - personal, societal (which we can use the court for)
