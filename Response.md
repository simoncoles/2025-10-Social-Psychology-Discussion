## Post 1 Question 1


### Question

"Do you think Coleen Rooney’s social psychology experiment was ethical given it was conducted outside the context of institutional research?"

From lecturer: "the debate is about everyday ethics (Coleen's approach) versus institutional ethics (for example, BPS ethics). Please focus your analysis specifically on the sting operation itself, although if you think you need to include the wider legal/media context, that is fine."

So when analysing her actions, we're doing it through the lens of "Everyday Ethics"

### Initial thoughts

When considering Coleen's actions through an Ethics lens we need to:
- Consider the context of her actions
- Choose an ethical stance to take

Coleen used a standard leak-detection technique to understand how tabloid newspapers were getting her private information. Tabloid newspapers have been notorious for illegal activities, for example the long-running "Phone Hacking" scandal recently dramatised by the BBC. Rooney's Barrister David Sherborne known for his work on the Phone Hacking cases. 

It is notable that Varny brought her defamation case based on Rooney's accusations towards her, not on how that evidence was collected. That evidence was subsequently used in the court case to meet the difficult burden of truth as a defence against defamation. If there were ethical concerns Varney's legal team would have gone for them, and they didn't.

From the lofty heights of academia it might be tempting to pick a more refined ethical framwork, e.g. Kantian duty ethics vs consequentialism but we are examining the conduct of two social media "influencers" and the tabloid press in a case which has received substantial legal and press attention. 

Let us assume an appropriate benchmark would be "The man on the Clapham Omnibus". 

We should conclude that Rooney's actions were ethical in the context she was in. If she was doing Psychology research, she would need to pay careful attention to the deception provisions of the BPS ethics code, although again given the context it may be she's not actually decieving anyone as the information wasn't meant for disemmination. 

The bigger lesson is this cult of celebrity does no one any good, and it cheapens everyone involved. An interesting legal case study it is, but from an ethics standpoint it's such a slam dunk I've had to go on a detour to fill out the word count. Perhaps the more interesting question is why is an august academic institution sullying itself by pretending it is interesting?

What ethics standards can we bring to bear on the actions of an individual - personal, societal (which we can use the court for)

Find a paper about using ethics to analyse every day actions
Did she meet those reasonable expectations

Find soemthing about standard leak detection
Refer back to phone hacking, seen in that context too

Then look at what the court found

What either one didn’t wasn’t illegal or indeed unethical
The harm to Vardy was at her own hand
That Vardy sued for defamation indicated she felt her actions were unethical/shameful

The legal case was libel/defmation not the act so their judgement on the ethics wasn’t a thing

## Post 1 Question 2

"Should we apply the same ethical standards to research conducted by institutions and research we conduct in our everyday lives?"

No, we should hold institutions to a higher standard
- They have power, either explicity (e.g. teachers, police) or implicitly by reputation (University holding themselves up as being reputable)
- They have a degree of liability shield for individuals as long as those individuals follow process
- 

It is also important for institutions to protect their reputation 

This happens in many fields as a matter of course, for example consumers have more rights than businesses against unfairness. Employment law means a work relationship has many more constraints in terms of behaviour than you would have in a personal relationship.
