## Post 1 Question 1


### Question

"Do you think Coleen Rooneyâ€™s social psychology experiment was ethical given it was conducted outside the context of institutional research?"

From lecturer: "the debate is about everyday ethics (Coleen's approach) versus institutional ethics (for example, BPS ethics). Please focus your analysis specifically on the sting operation itself, although if you think you need to include the wider legal/media context, that is fine."

So when analysing her actions, we're doing it through the lens of "Everyday Ethics"

### Initial thoughts

What ethics standards can we bring to bear on the actions of an individual - personal, societal (which we can use the court for)

Find a paper about using ethics to analyse every day actions
Did she meet those reasonable expectations

Then look at what the court found


## Post 1 Question 2

"Should we apply the same ethical standards to research conducted by institutions and research we conduct in our everyday lives?"

No, we should hold institutions to a higher standard
- They have power, either explicity (e.g. teachers, police) or implicitly by reputation (University holding themselves up as being reputable)
- They have a degree of liability shield for individuals as long as those individuals follow process
- 

It is also important for institutions to protect their reputation 

This happens in many fields as a matter of course, for example consumers have more rights than businesses against unfairness. Employment law means a work relationship has many more constraints in terms of behaviour than you would have in a personal relationship.
